Assignment Name: -. MongoDB Map Reduce

Title of Assignment: Implement Map reduce operation with suitable example using MongoDB.

Theory: -
Map-Reduce
• Map-reduce is a data processing paradigm for condensing
large volumes of data into useful aggregated results. For mapreduce operations, MongoDB provides the mapReduce database command.
• Consider the following map-reduce operation:
MapReduce:

Map-Reduce:
In very simple terms, the mapReduce command takes 2 primary inputs, the mapper function and the reducer function.
A Mapper will start off by reading a collection of data and building a Map with only the required fields we wish to process and group them into one array based on the key.
And then this key value pair is fed into a Reducer, which will process the values.
Map-Reduce Syntax:
db.collection.mapReduce(
function() {emit(key, value);},
function(key,values) {return reduceFunction},
{
out: collection, query: document, sort: document,
limit: number
}
)
Map-Reduce Syntax Explanation:
The above map-reduce function will query the collection, and then map the output documents to the emit key-value pairs. After this, it is
reduced based on the keys that have multiple values. Here, we have used the following functions and parameters.
• Map: – It is a JavaScript function. It is used to map a value with a key and produces a key-value pair.
• Reduce: – It is a JavaScript function. It is used to reduce or group together all the documents which have the same key.
• Out: – It is used to specify the location of the map-reduce query output.
• Query: – It is used to specify the optional selection criteria for selecting documents.
• Sort: – It is used to specify the optional sort criteria.
• Limit: – It is used to specify the optional maximum number of documents which are desired to be returned.

Conclusion: Here we performed Mapreduce operation with suitable example using MongoDB.
